# OlympusVSI-to-OME-TIFF
Scripted (MatLab) Bioformat conversion of *.vsi files (data tree) to *.ome.tiff. It requires modifying the Java JDK MaxHeapSize to successfully convert 10X or 20X z-stack image pyramids. It replaces the need to do Image>Combine Frames (as Z-stack) in Olympus software (AWS or Olyvia).

If using this script in your research papers, please cite the Bioformat community (links in the code), MatLab, and the author (Marco Andres ACEVEDO ZAMORA). A video can be provided showing how to use the code by contacting me.

Thanks.
